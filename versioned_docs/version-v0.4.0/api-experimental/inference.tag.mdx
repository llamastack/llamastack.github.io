Llama Stack Inference API for generating completions, chat completions, and embeddings.

This API provides the raw interface to the underlying models. Three kinds of models are supported:
- LLM models: these models generate "raw" and "chat" (conversational) completions.
- Embedding models: these models generate embeddings to be used for semantic search.
- Rerank models: these models reorder the documents based on their relevance to a query.
